## Notes

This is a upgraded version of my previous Matlab TransYou, which turns
a input picture into composition of small pictures. The picture here are
taken from 3 public datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10. There are
total 233000 small images.

The example image is from one of my old friend.
